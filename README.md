# Machine Learning & Data Science Case Studies

## Project Overview
This repository contains multiple case studies and practical exercises for understanding and applying key concepts in statistics, machine learning, and predictive modeling. The goal is to strengthen analytical and modeling skills using Python and real-world datasets.

## Case Studies & Files
1. **Case_Study_Common_Statistical_Test1.ipynb** – Analysis of common statistical tests for data inference.  
2. **Case_Study_Common_Statistical_Test2.ipynb** – Extended exercises on statistical tests and hypothesis evaluation.  
3. **Case_Study_Estimation_Theory.ipynb** – Estimation techniques and parameter inference in datasets.  
4. **Case_Study_Inferential_Statistics.ipynb** – Practical application of inferential statistics for decision making.  
5. **Case_Study_Logistic_Regression.ipynb** – Implementation and analysis of logistic regression models.  
6. **Predictive_Modeling_Case_Study.ipynb** – End-to-end predictive modeling case study, including model building and evaluation.
